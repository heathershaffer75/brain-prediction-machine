# 🧠 Your Brain Is a Prediction Machine (Group Board)

A lightweight, no-login, GitHub Pages app designed for SUD + Primary Mental Health groups.

## What it does
- Builds two live columns:
  - **What my brain predicts will help**
  - **What actually helps**
- Tags items by pattern: Craving, Anxiety, Avoidance, People-pleasing, Catastrophizing, Rumination, Low mood/Shame, Other
- Optional **Patient Mode** adds personal notes + export.
- Works offline after first load (browser cached).
- Exports a clean text summary for documentation or facilitator notes.

## Run it on GitHub Pages

2. Add `index.html` at the root of the repo.
3. Settings → Pages → Build and deployment:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
